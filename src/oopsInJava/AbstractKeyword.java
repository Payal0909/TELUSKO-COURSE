//        abstract method can only be defined under abstract class
//      and the child class should contain the parent class declared function definitions
//        i.e. if we are extending the abstract class we need to define all its super class declared functions
//    Cannot create object of the abstract car

//        Abstract class can or cant have abstract method . there is no compulsion of that
